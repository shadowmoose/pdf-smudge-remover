# PDF Smudge Remover
[Check out the tool in-browser.](https://shadowmoose.github.io/pdf-smudge-remover/)

## Overview
Do you keep finding smudges or unwanted marks on your scanned PDF documents?
Do they always somehow seem to block out the name of that person you really need to see? 
Fret no more! The PDF Smudge Remover is here to help you clean up your PDFs with ease.

For any documents with unsightly overlays, this tool will attempt to read the text behind them.
Simply select every PDF you'd like to process in a batch, and let the tool produce an archive of the cleaned text files.
It may not be perfect, but hey - it's better than copying and pasting.

This tool is entirely browser-based and local, so your documents never leave your computer.
The resulting text files are streamed to your downloads folder, combined into a single ZIP archive.

## Notes
This tool is more or less just an incredibly basic proof of concept,
created because there seem to be a lot of people who could use something like this currently.
It may be expended on in the future if I regain interest in OCR or character spacing algorithms.

Currently, it relies on the document still containing the original text data behind the overlays, 
typically seen when somebody highlights text (in yellow OR black) in a PDF or adds annotations.

## Contributions
If you have a method you like to employ when extracting document text,
feel free to raise a ticket (or better yet, a pull request) and I'll be happy to take a look.
The more options we can offer, the merrier.
